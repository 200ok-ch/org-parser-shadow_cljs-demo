* =org-parser= shadow-cljs demo

Sample project to demo the issue discussed in
https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser/issues/61.

** Development

The project was created by following the [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs][shadow-cljs documentation]].

1. =npx create-cljs-project acme-app=
2. Create minimal http server and web client config in =shadow-cljs.edn=
   and =main/acme/frontend/app.cljs=
3. Edit shadow-cljs.edn and add [org-parser "0.1.27-SNAPSHOT"] under =dependencies=

Then, install org-parser locally, so you can test out different
scenarios: =lein uberjar; lein install=

Finally, start the shadow-cljs project: =npx shadow-cljs watch
frontend=.

With org-parser =master=, the project starts, but the org-parser code
does not run. When visiting http://localhost:8080, there is an error
in the JS console.
